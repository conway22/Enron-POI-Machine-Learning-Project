# Enron-POI-Machine-Learning-Project

In this project, I played detective, and put my machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

During this project I completed the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

I learned how to extract and identify useful features that best represent your data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithms. 

By the end of the project, you was be able to:

Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset. Validate a machine learning result using test data. Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics. Create, select and transform features. Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms. Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance. Communicate your machine learning algorithm results clearly
